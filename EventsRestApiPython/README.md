# RESTful Events API - Python

This sample shows how to trigger and retrieve events from a Python application.

The sample logs into the server, retrieves any existing user-defined event, triggers it, retrieves the event by id and retrieves all stored events with their metadata.

## Prerequisites

- XProtect 2023 R2 or later.
- The API Gateway installed on the same host as the management server.
- A user with the Administrators role.
- An existing user defined event with event type retention policy greater than 0 days.
- Python version 3.7 or newer.
- The Python packages 'requests' and 'requests-ntlm'. To install the package:
  - In a command prompt, enter `pip install <package-name>`.
  - In Visual Studio Solution Explorer, select a Python environment under Python Environments, then from the context menu select Manage Python Packages and search for *\<package-name>*.

The sample is verified with the following versions of Python packages:

- requests: 2.26.0
- requests-ntlm: 1.2.0
- urllib3: 1.26.16

Using different package versions might result in unexpected errors when running the sample.
