# Chat with WebSockets Messages API - JavaScript

This sample shows how to publish and subscribe to messages from a JavaScript browser application.

The sample gets a token from IDP, connects to the messaging service, subscribes and publishes messages.

Open the sample in two different tabs and send messages between them. You can also test the sample with a Chat plugin sample running in another XProtect component like Smart Client (see _mipsdk-samples-plugin/ChatWithWebsockets_).

This sample is not production ready and has been kept simple in purpose. Learn about:

- [Handling reconnections](/mipvmsapi/api/messages-ws/v1/#section/API-reference/Session-lifecycle)
- [Receiving acknowledgements](/mipvmsapi/api/messages-ws/v1/#section/API-reference/Ack)
